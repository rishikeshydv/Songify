# spotifyETL_project
In this project, I have built a data pipeline using Spotify API. This feed will run daily, and it will download the data about the songs that you listened to during a day, and save that data in a SQLite database on your local machine. For example: the data storing process will continue throughout the year. Using these data, you can find a pattern in these data.
