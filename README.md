In this project, I have built a data pipeline using Spotify API. 

The DAG file (spotify_dag.py) works in the backend with spotify_project.py to daily run, download the data about the songs that a user listens to during a day, and save that data in a SQLite database on the local machine. 

In the long term, the data storing process can help us make database. Using these data, you can find a pattern in these data.
